This section is for projects I've done for the organizations I've worked for. Source codes are not available.

    - Runs custom scripts, including non-Python scripts, with `subprocess.Popen`.
    - personal customizations with `rich`

## Deutsche Bank (2018 - 2021)

- YukiBot — a Python module which combines the `pandas` and `pywin32` to download thousands of line items from SAP.
- PyGGL — a Python application intended to interact with an Excel ribbon with password-protected code.
- Jupyter Notebooks
    - Mostly for reconciliation of ledger balances.
    - Used Papermill to parameterize and execute the notebooks.
