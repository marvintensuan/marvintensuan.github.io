## Web Development

- [cv-flask](https://github.com/marvintensuan/cv-flask) — [My Curriculum Vitae website](https://www.marvintensuan.com/) with a Flask backend, deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Scripting 
- [My-Data-Migrations](https://github.com/marvintensuan/My-Data-Migrations) — Compilation of Python scripts used to move data from one source to another. It uses tools like `praw` (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and `psycopg2` to move data between sources like a Postgresql instance at Cloud SQL and Firestore.
- [cloud-sql-proxy-wrapper](https://github.com/marvintensuan/cloud-sql-proxy-wrapper) — A script to set-up `Cloud SQL Proxy` on my Windows machine. Cloud SQL Proxy provides secure access to Google Cloud SQL instances without the need for Authorized Networks or for configuring SSL.
- [PICPA_La_Robot](https://github.com/marvintensuan/PICPA_La_Robot) — A Reddit script bot which uses `praw` and `pywin32` to scrape from MS Outlook to post the latest PICPA events via /u/PICPA_La_Robot.
