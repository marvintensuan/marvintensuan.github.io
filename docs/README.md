# Hi, I'm Marvin

Welcome to my Github Account.

I have been programming with Python for about <Experience /> years now, both casually and professionally. I work as a Financial Analyst for investment banks. Most of my work revolve around data analysis and scripting, as well as dealing with the infrastructure to deploy my scripts and modules to other users.

My GitHub repositories are mostly filled with personal projects I did during my free time.
